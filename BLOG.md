# Supercharge Your Airtable Automations: Introducing Our Advanced n8n Node

We're excited to announce the release of n8n-nodes-airtable, a powerful community node developed by Velocity BPA that takes your Airtable integrations to the next level.

## The Problem with Standard Airtable Integration

While n8n's native Airtable integration covers basic operations, many users hit a wall when trying to leverage Airtable's more advanced capabilities. Formula fields, complex filtering, and sophisticated data transformations often require workarounds or multiple nodes to achieve desired results. This creates unnecessarily complex workflows and maintenance headaches.

## Advanced Formula Support Changes Everything

Our new node bridges this gap by providing native support for Airtable formulas directly within your n8n workflows. Whether you're calculating dates, concatenating fields, or applying conditional logic, you can now handle it seamlessly without jumping through hoops.

## Key Features

- **Native Formula Support**: Work with Airtable formula fields as easily as standard fields
- **Enhanced Filtering**: Build sophisticated queries with formula-based filters
- **Improved Data Handling**: Better support for complex field types and relationships
- **Seamless Integration**: Works alongside existing n8n nodes without conflicts
- **Regular Updates**: Actively maintained with community feedback driving development

## Getting Started in Minutes

Installing the node is straightforward. Simply run:


npm install n8n-nodes-airtable


Then restart your n8n instance, and you'll find the advanced Airtable node available in your node palette.

## Open Source and Community-Driven

This node is fully open source and available on GitHub at https://github.com/Velocity-BPA/n8n-nodes-airtable. We welcome contributions, feature requests, and bug reports from the community.
